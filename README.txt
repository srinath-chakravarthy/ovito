Change Log 
****************************************************************************************

Release 2.6.2 (19-Mar-16):

 - Updated the built-in SSH client to support more encryption methods and improve compatibility with some SSH servers.
 - Small bug fix that solves a (rare) problem with the display of dislocation lines in periodic systems.
 - For very small, periodic simulation cells the Elastic Strain Calculation modifier silently failed for 
   diamond crystals. Now the user is informed that the Show Periodic Images modifier should be applied first 
   to extend the box size.
 - Fixed output of animated GIF files on Linux.
 - Reduced memory footprint of the DXA analysis modifier.
 - The Slice modifier now also cuts surface meshes generated by the Construct Surface Mesh modifier and 
   dislocation lines generated by the DXA analysis modifier.
 - Introduced basic support for 2D systems. The 2D flag can be set in the simulation cell properties panel. 
   The Atomic Strain and Coordination Analysis modifiers then perform the computation in 2D (i.e. the XY plane). 
 - Key-value pairs read from extended XYZ file headers and the LAMMPS timestep number are now accessible from 
   Python via the new DataCollection.attributes property.
 - Added the 'Number of bins' parameter to the Coordination Analysis modifier, allowing the user to control 
   the resolution of the generated RDF histogram.
 - Errors generated by Python scripts that are run via the 'Run script file' function are now displayed in the GUI.
 - Re-added the 'Every nth frame' field to the Render Settings panel, which allows rendering only a subset of 
   animation frames.
 - Fixed import of 'Aspherical Shape' particle property values from a file.
 - The export_file() script function can now produce multi-timestep files.
 - Improved automatic detection of PDB files and added parsing of bonds defined by CONECT records.
 - Fixed bug in Elastic Strain Calculation modifier, which got stuck in infinite loop when applied to some 
   complex polycrystalline structures.
 - Moving the viewport camera no longer stops animation playback.
 - Added the 'Vector Color' particle property, which allows changing the display color of vector arrows on a 
   per-particle basis.
 - Bug fix: The Create Bonds modifier reported the number of half-bonds, not the number of full bonds generated.
 - Regression: Restricting the Compute Property modifier to selected particles did not work correctly; 
   existing values for unselected particles were always reset to zero.
 - Added the CA file exporter, which allows saving DXA analysis results to disk (and load them again at a later time).

Release 2.6.1 (15-Nov-15):

 - Vector arrows can now be centered on particles, e.g. to visualize magnetic moments.
 - The Tachyon renderer now supports transparent backgrounds.
 - The Color Legend and Axis Tripod viewport overlays can now be repositioned with the mouse.
 - Display objects, which are generated by long-running modifiers, no longer temporarily disappear 
   from the pipeline editor list while playing an animation. 
 - The PDB file parser now accepts text lines with up to 83 characters to support files written 
   by Accelrys Discovery Studio.
 - Fixed regression in CA file importer, which was broken in last release.

Release 2.6.0 (02-Nov-15):

 - Added the <a+c> dislocation type for HCP crystals to the Dislocation Analysis modifier.
 - Added the Elastic Strain Calculation modifier, which computes the atomic-level elastic 
   strain and deformation gradient tensors in crystalline systems. It can be used to 
   analyze local elastic distortions in a crystal lattice and to determine the local 
   crystal orientation.
 - The modification pipeline editor now supports drag and drop to change the order of 
   modifiers in the pipeline. 
 - Added the Dislocation Inspection utility, which displays further information 
   about dislocation segments extracted by the Dislocation Analysis modifier.
 - Added an introduction to OVITO's animation system to the manual, which explains how to 
   animate parameters and the camera.
 - The Compute Property modifier can now perform computations that take into account the 
   local neighborhood of particles. For example, you can use this to average a quantity 
   over spherical regions around each particle.
 - Added a 'bond-based' mode to the Common Neighbor Analysis modifier, which computes the CNA 
   indices based on existing bonds between particles. The modifier also outputs the computed 
   CNA bond indices as a new bond property. This enables, for example, analyses of disordered 
   systems using the classical CNA.
 - It is now possible to write custom modifiers in Python.
 - The Wigner-Seitz analysis modifier can now break down the computed site occupancy number 
   into per-type numbers. This makes it easier to identify antisite defects, for example.
 - Added a 'Use only selected particles' option to the Common Neighbor Analysis and the 
   Identify Diamond Structure modifiers, which allows identifying sub-lattices.
 - Added the NearestNeighborFinder Python class, which can be used from Python scripts to 
   find the N nearest neighbors of a particle.
 - Viewports are no longer automatically zoomed to show everything when replacing the currently 
   loaded dataset with a new one. This makes it easier to preserve the current view configuration 
   when switching to a different simulation file.
 - Bug fixes in Python-ASE interface - Cell matrix is transposed and duplicate properties are handled.
 - Fixed the assignment of dislocation lines that were loaded from a CrystalAnalysis file to 
   Burgers vectors families. The CA file import was broken since version 2.4.4.
 - Python scripts can now access the dislocation lines extracted by the DislocationAnalysisModifier. 
 - Bug fix: Bond properties like the bond type are now updated when dangling bonds are removed 
   due to deleted particles.
 - Fixed bug in Atomic Strain modifier, which produced weird results when PBC flags of reference 
   configuration do not match PBC flags of deformed configuration. Now PBC flags of deformed 
   configuration always override the boundary conditions of the reference simulation cell.
 - Fixed error in ovito.dataset.scene_nodes.__iter__() Python method.
 - Fixed bug in file parser that led to wrong particle type names when loading a 
   multi-frame XYZ file with varying set of named atom types.

Release 2.5.1 (07-Aug-15):

 - The LAMMPS data file exporter can now produce files with LAMMPS atom styles other than 'atomic'. 
   It also exports bonds if present.
 - Arbitrary triclinic simulation cells can now be exported to the LAMMPS data file format. 
   They will be automatically transformed to the canonical LAMMPS representation.
 - The LAMMPS data file parser now reads bond types, and you can change the display color of 
   individual bond types in OVITO.
 - Added the fmod(A,B) math function to the Compute Property and Expression Select modifiers.
 - Added visualization support for cylindrical and spherocylindrical particles.

   including the standard ones defined by the IMD format, must now be explicitly selected by the user.
 - Integrated DXA (Dislocation Extraction Algorithm) into OVITO. 
 - Voronoi analysis modifier can now output bonds between neighboring atoms which share a Voronoi face.
 - Python scripting interface now allows conversion to/from ASE Atoms objects.
 - Python scripting interface now supports write access to particle properties and procedural 
   generation of input particle datasets for OVITO's modification pipeline.
 - Bug fix: Large number of simultaneous SFTP download requests led to error message 
   'SFTP error: Server could not start session'.
 - Bug fix: Using the Python viewport overlay led to program crash on Windows 8 x64.
 - Scripting function Viewport.render() now returns the rendered image, which can be manipulated 
   before saving it to disk.

 - Fixed OpenGL rendering of bonds/arrows on certain Windows/NVidia systems.
 - Added import/export support for FHI-aims file format.
 - Colors and radii used for particle types (as well as structure types) can now be predefined 
   by the user.
 - Migrated to version 5.4 of the Qt library. This may affect OpenGL rendering and the viewport 
   display. Please report any issues that you experience.
 - Bin & Reduce modifier now takes into account the simulation box origin, uses double precision 
   numbers to perform calculations, and 1D-plot now spans the entire interval.
 - Bug fix: NetCDF file importer doesn't close file handle, leading to error after loading several thousand frames.
 - Bug fix: LAMMPS data file parser stumbles over 'AngleTorsion Coeffs' file section.
 - Visualization of particle trajectory lines.

   OpenGL contexts and the use of OpenGL point sprites. This allows to work around compatibility
   problems on some systems.
 - User can now choose between dark and light viewport color schemes.
 - Added scripting interface for Tachyon renderer.
 - Added support for variable particle numbers in NetCDF reader (i.e. support for unlimited atom dimension)
   and for NC_CHAR variables as particle types. (I.e. particle types given by names instead of numbers.)
 - Added user options that control the automatic fetching of the news page from the web server and 
   the transmission of the installation ID.
 - Fixed bug in camera orbit mode, not correctly restricting camera's orientation when coordinate system 
   orientation has been changed.

Release 2.3.2 (07-Apr-14):

 - When opening a XYZ file, the column mapping dialog displays an excerpt of the file content to help the user in figuring out the mapping.
 - The Construct Surface Modifier no longer creates cap polygons if the simulation cell doesn't contain any particles.

Release 2.3.0 (29-Mar-14):

 - Added the new scripting interface, which allows to automate tasks.

 - Added more input variables to the 'Compute property' and 'Expression select' modifiers (e.g. reduced particle 
   coordinates and simulation cell size).
 - It's now possible to load a sequence of files with each file containing multiple frames. To do this, import the 
   first file from the sequence, activate the option "File contains multiple timesteps", finally open the 
   "Frame sequence" panel and change the wildcard pattern to include the '*' placeholder character again.
 - Fixed bug in CFG file importer, which did not read triclinic simulation cells correctly.
 - Fixed shader compilation error on OpenGL 2.0 systems and some other OpenGL related issues.
   
Release 2.2.4 (29-Jan-14):

 - Modified particle file importers to ensure stable ordering of particle types (using 
   lexicographical ordering when atom types have names, and ID-based ordering otherwise). 
   The ordering of named particle types is now independent of their first occurrence in the input file.
 - Fixed particle picking issue on computers with Intel graphics.
 - Fixed OpenGL issues on systems with Intel graphics.
 - Fixed blurred display of viewport captions.
 - Fixed program crash when changing particle radius/color without having selected a particle type first. 
 - OVITO is now built using version 5.2.1 of the Qt library. 
   This fixes several issues related to the graphical user interface. 

Release 2.2.3 (15-Jan-14):

 - Fixed the CFG file importer, which is now able to read CFG files written by newer versions of LAMMPS correctly.
   Auxiliary file columns are now automatically mapped to OVITO's standard particle properties if possible.
 - Improved compatibility with some OpenGL implementations (Intel HD graphics on Windows and ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470).
 - A 64-bit version of the program for Windows has been built.
 - A construction grid can now be shown in the viewports (like it was possible with OVITO 1.x). 

Release 2.2.2 (05-Jan-14):

 - Fixed regression: Rendering a movie with Ovito 2.2.1 resulted in an empty file.
 - Fixed display of the selection polygon when using the Fence selection mode of the Manual Selection modifier.
 - Added --glversion command line option, which allows to request a specific OpenGL standard.

Release 2.2.1 (26-Dec-13):

 - Added a file parser for binary LAMMPS dump files.
 - Added a dialog window that displays information about the system's OpenGL graphics driver. This dialog can be accessed via the Help menu.
 - Fixed bug in the Expression Select and Compute Property modifiers, which couldn't handle particle property names that start with a number.
 - The OpenGL compatibility profile is now used instead of the core profile on Windows and Linux platforms.
 - Fixed an issue in the Construct Surface Mesh modifier, which sometimes led to a program crash on Windows.

Release 2.2.0 (15-Dec-13):

 - Added the Cluster Analysis modifier.
 - Added the Construct Surface Mesh modifier.
 - Added possibility to open multiple application windows (useful on Mac OS X platform).
 - Added user option to the viewport settings dialog that allows to turn off the restriction of 
   the vertical camera rotation. 
 - Added first version of the CrystalAnalysis plugin, which allows working with data 
   produced by the Crystal Analysis Tool.
 - The XYZ file exporter now writes particle type names instead of numeric type IDs.
 - Extended user documentation.
 - The user manual is now distributed with the program. An Internet connection is no longer
   necessary to access it.
 - A few bug fixes and OpenGL compatibility improvements.

Release 2.1.0 (15-Nov-13):

 - Added the Manual Selection modifier, which allows selecting individual particles
   with the mouse in the viewports. Using its "Fence selection" mode, a group of particles
   can be selected by drawing a closed path around them.
 - In addition to spherical particles, OVITO can now display particles with cubic and square shape.
   This can be useful for visualization of large lattice systems, Ising models, etc.
 - OVITO can now import more than one dataset into the scene and display them side by side. 
   Use the "Import Local/Remote File" function multiple times to load 
   several simulation files (or multiple instances of the same file) into the program.
   Each dataset has its own modification pipeline, i.e., one can customize the 
   visualization of each dataset separately. Use the Affine Transformation modifier
   to move one of the datasets to a different location such that multiple
   objects do not overlap.
 - A new VTK file importer allows reading triangle meshes into OVITO to visualize
   geometric objects such as an indentor tip. The VTK format is the native format
   used by the ParaView software and can, for instance, be written by LIGGGHTS/LAMMPS.
 - Camera objects can be created through the viewport context menu. A viewport can be 
   linked to a camera object to show the the corresponding view. Camera objects can
   be animated (that's still an experimental and incomplete feature).
 - When importing a sequence of simulation snapshots into OVITO, one can now configure
   the mapping of input frames to OVITO's animation frames. This allows to generate output
   movies with less (or more) frames than the imported snapshot sequence. 
 - The Tachyon renderer now supports semi-transparent particles. The transparency is controlled
   through the "Transparency" particle property. Use, for instance, the Computer Property
   modifier to set this property for certain particles. The transparency values can range
   from 0 (=fully opaque) to 1 (=not visible).
 - Fixed saving/loading of the selected gradient type in the Color Coding modifier.
 - Fixed a program deadlock when when dragging the time slider after loading a file sequence.
   from a remote location.

Release 2.0.3 (22-Oct-13):

 - Ported Tachyon raytracing renderer from old OVITO 1.1.0 release. This software-based 
   rendering engine allows to produce images with high-quality shading and ambient
   occlusion lighting.
 - The Create Bonds modifier will automatically turn off the display of bonds when 
   creating a large number of bonds (>1 million), which would make the program freeze.
 - The Displacement Vectors modifier now supports relative reference frames, i.e.,
   displacements can be calculated from two snapshots separated by a fixed time interval.
   Before this addition, the modifier could only compute displacements with respect
   to a fixed simulation snapshot.
 - Fixed bug in the Affine Transformation modifier leading to recursive updates.
 - Added support for computers with high-resolution (Retina) displays.
 - The 'Inspect Particle' applet now lets one select multiple particles and can report 
   distances and angles.
 - Added 'Clear history' button to remote file import dialog.
 - POSCAR file exporter now writes the new file format, which includes atom type names.

Release 2.0.2 (30-Sep-13):

 - Fixed loading of multi-timestep files with names containing a digit.
 - Fixed import of CFG file with atom type information.

Release 2.0.1 (27-Sep-13):

 - Fixed loading of file sequences based on wildcard pattern on Windows platform.
 - Replaced const arrays in GLSL shaders with uniform variables to support older Intel graphics chips.
